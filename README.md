# CitiBike Analysis

Data ETL:

1. I extratcted the data from the New York CitBike website which was then combined in Jupyter Notebook and loaded into Tableau as a single data source.
2. I chose 9 months worth of data from pre-Covid times during 2019, assuming 2019 was a relatively stable historical reference.  I chose 9 months since it would represent all 4 seasons of the year (I exluded November, December, & January since I reasoned that the month of February alone would represent winter adequately).  I reasoned that spring, summer, and fall would provide adequate data to draw conclusions from.

Anaylsis:

During the timeframe chosen, there were 595 bicycles available to rent from CitiBike, with 334,746 trips logged between all bikes.  The most popular stations for starting and ending a route were Grove St. PATH & Hamilton Park.  Grove St PATH was by far the most popular which makes sense because of its central location in the Downtown Jersey City area, where the station resides at a major intersection, likely providing walkability to desirable destinations.  Additionally, most of the popular stations are also in the downtown area, suggesting bike riding is more convenient due to traffic and exorbitant parking costs that large cities are known for.  Sip Ave station is one notable outlier in that it has high popularity but is not located in the downtown area.  This phenomena may be explained because it acts as a main hub for people riding bikes from the surrounding areas outside of downtown.  The map background layer suggests a larger parking area adjacent to Sip Ave station, where people may drive from the surrounding areas, park, and rent bikes and then travel to their final destinations.

Additionally, the data shows that CitiBike usage generally increases during the warmer months and decreases during the cooler months and male subscribers make up the majority of usage.  Weather, such as snowy roads make it less practical & safe to travel via bicycle in the winter. The gender discrepancy could be explained that males feel safer than women traveling alone on busy streets in a big city.  The fact that most male users are also subscribers suggests these men use bikes to travel to & from work during the week and require regular transport accessibility.
